# jupyter-scala

Jupyter Lab ❤️ Scala, integrating [almond](https://almond.sh/) and [metals-lsp](https://scalameta.org/metals/).

This project is all follow the [introduction](https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) of JupyterLab lsp, especially [Scala Language Server (metals) integration](https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuring.html#example-scala-language-server-metals-integration) helped me extremely.
